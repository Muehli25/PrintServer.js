# PrintServer
I have a ubuntu server with cups running for my printer in my apartment. 
Printing with macOS or iOS is not a problem, but with Windows 10 there are problems with the printer driver. 
So I decided to build a simple webapp, where my roommates can simple upload PDF (possible other formats) and they will be printed.
